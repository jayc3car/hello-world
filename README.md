# hello-world
First repository!

I am not going to be finishing a bachelor's degree in software development because I plan to get out of the IT industry. I want to eventually get a bachelor's in Biology, posibly. The end goal is to have a job/career where I would be working outside or moving around, instead of sitting for 8 hours each day. I still love coding and want to learn more about web development so that I can continue to code on the side throughout the rest of my life.
